Three things collided in my head today:

- *The West Wing*
- Ron Carlson's concept of "inventory" in fiction
- TV episode recaps

Over the past few days
I re-watched the four episodes of *The West Wing*
where Zoey is kidnapped,
leading President Bartlet
to transfer the presidency temporarily to the Speaker of the House.

As I watched the recap,
I realized that this episode started in the middle of a crisis.
So I stopped it and launched "Commencement,"
the episode that preceded "Twenty Five."
And I watched the recap for that episode, too.

That scene is inventory.

Suddenly
I want to pay closer attention to the scenes that appear in recaps.
Each recap scene represents some conflict
that reaches beyond its original episode
into the current one.

That is,
each recap snippet carries *inventory.*

I'm especially interested in the snippets of inventory
more than one or two episodes old.

Maybe some of those long-reaching scenes were inserted
with the idea that they would set up a conflict many episodes away.

But I suspect that many of them
were *found* inventory,
scenes written initially only to support the episodes they appeared in,
and later found to be carrying untapped potential,
some unsqueezed juice,
maybe a not-quite-entirely-resolved conflict,
or unexplored ramifications.

For example,
this entire sequence of episodes
calls back to a scene from early in the show,
episode 6 of season 1,
"Mr. Willis of Ohio,"
in which Bartlet yells at Zoey for taking her Secret Service protection lightly.

It's an utterly devastating scene.
Bartlet,
at the top of his lungs,
describes the nightmare scenario in his mind,
in which she is kidnapped,
and he is out of his mind,
unable to perform as president.

By the time Bartlet stops yelling,
Zoey is in tears,
shaking.
(Every time I watch that episode, I end up in tears, shaking.)

In the end,
Zoey gets it.
She understands why her Secret Service protection matters.

The conflict is resolved.

Or seems to be.

Until "Commencement."

In "Commencement,"
the very scenario that Bartlet feared
comes to pass.

Three and a half seasons
after that earlier scene.

I suspect that when Sorkin wrote that scene in episode 6,
he had no idea he would dredge it up again
to set up his final episode.
Maybe he knew.
But Sorkin famously claims
never to have any idea what's going to happen next
in his shows.
So I suspect he didn't have "Commencement" in mind at the time.

That's a long-reaching bit of found inventory.
