I write fiction in a variety of genres,
including fantasy, science fiction, and mystery.
My short stories include
[Carrion Road](http://driscollbrookpress.com/title/carrion-road/),
[Yantriel's Privy](http://driscollbrookpress.com/title/yantriels-privy/),
and
[The Last Whiskey Bacon Cheddar Burger at Saint Florian's Abbey](http://driscollbrookpress.com/title/saint-florians-abbey/).

I have worked as a failed shoemaker,
reluctant dairy farmer,
and ruthless ice cream man.
For several years I monitored the nuclear test ban treaty,
making sure those pesky commies didn't blow up the planet.
(They didn't.)

When I'm not writing,
I advise software teams and leaders
about how to play nice together.
Colleagues in my industry
once created
[a special award for me](http://www.agilealliance.org/programs/gordon-pask-award/)
for being reasonable.

I live in California with my wife.
