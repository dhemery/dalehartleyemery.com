I’ve been bundled!

Well, one of my stories has been bundled.

The story is
*[The Curse of the Soiled Doves](http://DriscollBrookPress.com/title/soiled-doves),*
about a magical mystery that magically mystifies
a frustrated bureaucrat in California's Department of Thaumaturgy,

It's new.

Really new.

So new that it isn't even officially released yet.

But you can get your very own electronic copy of
*The Curse of the Soiled Doves **right this very minute***
as part of an awesome bundle called
*[The Fantasy in the City Bundle](https://bundlerabbit.com/fantasy-in-the-city)*.

So now you're wondering:
What the heck is a bundle?

A bundle is a small collection of books
that you can buy all together
at a low, low price.

How low?

Crazy low.

Check this out:
For $2.99—the list price of my not-even-officially-released-yet short story—you get not only *The Curse of the Soiled Doves,*
but also *seven other stories.*
All by terrific writers.

That's 37.375¢ per short story!
You can't even get a pack of Beemans Gum for 37.375¢!

Now, *that's* what I call value.

But that's not all!

For only 50¢ more,
you get *another four stories.*
All four other terrific writers!
That's 12 short stories for $3.49!

And that's a marginal cost of 12.5¢ for each of the additional four short stories.
So that's, like, wicked logical, economically-wise.

But wait! There's more!

For one more slim Kennedy half dollar,
you get *yet another eight stories.*
All—you guessed it—by terrific writers!
That's 20 short stories for $3.99!

I can't even tell you the marginal cost of these additional eight stories,
*because my calculator doesn't go that low!*

And here's the truly amazing thing:
There is no upper limit to how much you can pay for
*[The Fantasy in the City Bundle](https://bundlerabbit.com/fantasy-in-the-city)*!

Uh… hmmm.
Maybe that's not a great selling point.

But here's something:
At a click of a button,
you can donate a percentage of your payment to charity.
Think of what that will do for your karma!
That right there is a great selling point.

If you like my stories,
*[The Fantasy in the City Bundle](https://bundlerabbit.com/fantasy-in-the-city)*
is a great way to grab my so-new-it's-not-even-new-yet story
and discover a whole bunch of other writers
you will surely like.

They would like you, too, I bet.
I'm pretty sure about that.

If you don't like my stories,
buy
*[The Fantasy in the City Bundle](https://bundlerabbit.com/fantasy-in-the-city)*
anyway.
Because these are terrific writers!
Also that karma thing.
